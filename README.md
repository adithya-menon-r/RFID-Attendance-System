# RFID Attendance System

## About
The project leverages Arduino to build an RFID-based attendance system. It simulates reading RFID tags through the terminal and provides immediate feedback using an LCD Display and LED indicators. If the tag is valid, the system marks the student as present; otherwise, it indicates the tag is invalid. Student data is loaded from an external text file into an array of structs for efficient tracking. When the export button is pressed, the system generates a new text file containing the attendance data of all present students. This compact, automated solution simplifies attendance management while demonstrating seamless hardware-software integration.

This Project was created for the **23CSE201 (Procedural Programming using C)** course.
